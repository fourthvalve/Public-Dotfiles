This collection of files is my library of aliases and other bash stuff that should be applicable to anyone who is using a setup similar to mine.

# OS X (probably 10.5+ due to the dscl commands)
# bash
# git
# maven

I just source the main file in my .bash_profile, but it should be fine to source each file individually to leave certain things out.
